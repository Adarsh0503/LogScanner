This program will work with large files like 25MB or even significantly larger ones. It's specifically designed for handling large log files efficiently. Here's why it should work well:

    Memory-Mapped I/O: The primary method (scan_file_with_mmap) uses memory mapping, which doesn't load the entire file into memory at once. Instead, it creates a mapping between the file and memory that allows the operating system to efficiently manage which parts of the file are actually loaded.
    Line-by-Line Alternative: If you use the --no-mmap option, it falls back to a generator-based approach that reads one line at a time, which is also memory-efficient for large files.
    Parallel Processing: The program divides work across multiple CPU cores, which is particularly beneficial when you have multiple log files to scan.

For context, 25MB is actually a relatively modest size for this kind of tool. This approach should comfortably handle files that are hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes in size, though processing time will increase with file size.

If you're concerned about performance with your specific 25MB file, you can try both approaches:

    Default with memory mapping:

python script.py "search term" /path/to/directory

    Line-by-line processing:

python script.py "search term" /path/to/directory --no-mmap

The memory mapping approach will typically be faster for most modern systems, but the line-by-line approach might be more reliable on systems with limited memory.
