SQL Validator Tool - PowerPoint Content
Here's revised content for a 5-page presentation focusing only on your current implementation:
Slide 1: Introduction
Title: SQL Query Validator - Improving Deployment Reliability

Purpose: Validate SQL syntax before production deployment
Problem Statement: Unvalidated queries lead to runtime errors and failed deployments
Solution: Automated pre-deployment syntax validation

Slide 2: Current Implementation
Title: Syntax Validation Approach

Core Technology: ANTLR parser for comprehensive syntax checking
Key Capabilities:

Identifies syntax errors with precise line/position information
Handles complex SQL statements
Detects missing semicolons between statements



Slide 3: Technical Architecture
Title: Solution Components

Key Components:

SQL File Parser: Breaks SQL files into individual statements
ANTLR Integration: Validates statement syntax
Reporting Engine: Provides detailed error information


Workflow:

Upload SQL file → 2. Parse statements → 3. Validate syntax → 4. Report errors



Slide 4: Usage & Integration
Title: Deployment & Usage

Access Methods:

REST API for web interface
Command-line tool for batch processing
Directory scanning for validating multiple files


Integration Points:

Developer IDEs
CI/CD pipelines
Deployment workflows



Slide 5: Benefits & Future Roadmap
Title: Value & Next Steps

Current Benefits:

Early detection of syntax errors
Reduced production incidents
Improved developer productivity


Future Enhancements:
