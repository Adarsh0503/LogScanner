Slide 1: Introduction
Title: MariaDB Query Validator - Preventing Production Issues

Purpose: Pre-deployment validation of SQL queries to eliminate runtime errors
Problem Statement: Unvalidated queries risk syntax errors, schema inconsistencies, and data type mismatches
Business Impact: Reduces production incidents, improves deployment reliability, saves developer time

Slide 2: Technical Approach
Title: Comprehensive Validation Strategy

Three-Layer Validation:

Syntax Validation: Ensures SQL follows correct grammar rules
Schema Validation: Verifies tables and columns actually exist
Safe Execution: Tests queries without side effects


Key Features:

Table and column name verification against actual database schema
Data type compatibility checking
Performance analysis via execution plan review
Handles complex scenarios (joins, subqueries, procedures)



Slide 3: Implementation
Title: Solution Architecture

Core Components:

ANTLR Parser: Provides robust syntax validation
JDBC Metadata Service: Enables schema validation
Transaction Manager: Ensures safe execution without side effects


Integration Options:

REST API for integration with developer tools
Command-line interface for CI/CD pipelines
Directory scanning for bulk validation



Slide 4: Benefits & ROI
Title: Business Value & Return on Investment

Quantifiable Benefits:

Reduction in production incidents (estimated 60-80% fewer SQL-related issues)
Faster deployment cycles through pre-validation
Lower testing costs with early error detection


Risk Mitigation:

Prevents data corruption from invalid operations
Reduces downtime from failed deployments
Improves regulatory compliance through consistent validation



Slide 5: Next Steps & Metrics
Title: Implementation Plan & Success Metrics

Rollout Plan:

Developer team adoption (2 weeks)
Integration with CI/CD pipeline (2 weeks)
Mandatory pre-deployment check (1 week)


Success Metrics:

Number of SQL errors caught before deployment
Reduction in production rollbacks
Development time saved through early detection
User satisfaction with validation feedback


Future Enhancements:

Performance recommendation engine
SQL optimization suggestions
Cross-database compatibility checking
